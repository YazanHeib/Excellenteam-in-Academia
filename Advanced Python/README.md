# Excellenteam in the Academia - Advanced Python
Completed a practical course in advanced Python programming, starting with Python basics, Git, and command line tools. The course covered exception handling, logging, code reviews, and testing with pytest, as well as CI/CD and TDD practices. I learned to use advanced Python features like generators, data structures, type hints, and dataclasses. I also built web applications and REST APIs using Flask and Django, and worked with databases using SQLAlchemy and ORM. The course gave me hands-on experience in backend development with queues and prepared me to solve real-world problems using Pythonâ€™s tools and best practices.
